In the typographics realms some properties are not equal to the others. There is a relationship between the font-family, the font-weight, font-style, font-size and line-height. 


Regarding the strict matters of the font-size, there are multiple ways to handle it:
- Define a base font size and then use a scale (type-scale) to have the different variations;
- Match the x-height of multiple font to ensure a good proportion;
- Eyeballing the values;

# @TODO Create a small experiment to compute and see auto-magically the relation between a font-family and the font-size based on the x-height


Is there still some prefered value from the browser ? 
Should the size fall on an int or a byte ?
